    	<h4>
    		My name is Andrew Webberley and I will be teaching the KnightHawk Programming BootCamp.  I have 8 years of programming experience and am passionate about Computer Science.  The first time I taught this camp it was tons of fun for both the students and myself!  I want to encourage my students to enjoy programming, persevere in problem-solving, and always continue learning.

      	I personally would recommend investing your time into this class because it was entertaining and a good
challenge. The startup for everything was easy and simple, and the rest of the code was interesting and
cool. Any technical difficulty, very few, that occurred was easily fixed with the help of Andrew. Every day
that we had a class, we always accomplished something, whether it was complicated or easy! I would
highly recommend Andrew’s Knighthawk Bootcamp class! ~ Jordan, Student 6/9/2021

      Andrew’s Knighthawk bootcamp was very carefully thought out, with clear objectives for each. It was my
observation that Andrew intentionally planned for the student to accomplish meaningful and age
appropriate projects each day. In addition, Andrew’s instruction was clear and the 2 hour class, per day,
was a perfect amount of time to successfully train the students and complete the projects. The My son,
who had no previous experience, learned a great deal about programming and was excited to show
other’s what he had learned. The instruction, projects and length of each class was perfect and a great
value! I would definitely recommend Andrew’s Knighthawk Bootcamp for anyone interested in learning
about programming! He did a fantastic job! ~ Jennifer Testa, Parent 6/9/2021 </p>
